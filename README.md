# Arduino Fitness Game Controller
This project showcases an innovative Arduino-based controller that simulates the left analog stick of a gamepad, enabling control of in-game movements through physical activity. The controller is designed to be mounted on the user's back and integrates with exercise equipment like treadmills, stationary bikes, and ellipticals.
